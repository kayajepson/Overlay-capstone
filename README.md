# OVERLAY

AR style app that takes a user captured photo of an object, uploads the image to the Cloudinary API (utilizing the AI Background Removal add-on) to isolate the object, then overlay the result onto the user's camera feed. Briefly, it will allow users to display what a captured object will look like in a new space via their camera.
